## Quickstart

### Install Node.js

1. Install Node Version Manager (NVM)
    ```
    brew install nvm
    ```
    Then follow the instructions to update your `~/.bash_profile`.
1. Open a new terminal
1. Install the latest long term support (LTS) version of Node.js, currently `10.16.3`.
    ```
    nvm install 10.16.3
    ```

### Set up your project

1. Clone your fork to your local machine
1. Install Node.js dependencies
    ```
    npm install
    ```
1. Install an ESLint plugin for your editor. For example: [linter-eslint](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint) for Atom.
1. Install Postgres
    ```
     brew install postgresql
    ```
1. Start Postgres
    ```
    brew services start postgresql
    ```
1. Interact with the PostgreSQL database management system
PostgreSQL provides a built-in interface, called psql. It's a command-line tool that allows you to interact with databases. You can think of it like IRB: it's a REPL. Where IRB gives you a Ruby interface, psql's interface uses a different language: 'Structured Query Language', or SQL.
psql also adds a couple of commands on top of SQL, for interacting with the database system.
PostgreSQL also provides one built-in database, called postgres.
To start psql, type psql <database name> into a Terminal, where <database name> is the name of the database you want to interact with. So, typing psql postgres will give us direct access to that first database:
    ```
    $ psql postgres
    postgres=#
    ```
1. node-postgres  
Non-blocking PostgreSQL client for Node.js. Pure JavaScript and optional native libpq bindings.
Install
    ```
    $ npm install pg
    ```
1. Create a database using SQL
Now that we're in the psql REPL environment, let's create a database using SQL:
    ```
    postgres=# CREATE DATABASE "database_name_here";
    ```
The semicolon is important! SQL is an old language. You've got to end lines with semicolons.
1. Listing all database tables
You can use one of psql's special non-SQL commands to list databases:
    ```
    postgres=# \l
    ```
You can see the database you made, the given postgres database, and some template databases Postgres needs.
1. Quitting psql
You can leave psql in the following way:
    ```
    postgres=# \q
    ```

### Start

1. Start the server
    ```
    npm start
    ```
1. Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Test

* Run all tests
    ```
    npm test
    ```
* Run a check
    ```bash
    npm run lint              # linter only
    npm run test:unit         # unit tests only
    npm run test:integration  # integration tests only
    ```

#### Start test server

The server must be running locally with test configuration for the
integration tests to pass.
```
npm run start:test
```
This starts the server on port `3030` and uses the `acebook_test` MongoDB database,
so that integration tests do not interact with the development server.
