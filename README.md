## Quickstart
### Install Node.js
1. Install Node Version Manager (NVM)
    ```
    brew install nvm
    ```
    Then follow the instructions to update your `~/.bash_profile`.
1. Open a new terminal
1. Install the latest long term support (LTS) version of Node.js, currently `10.16.3`.
    ```
    nvm install 10.16.3
    ```
### Set up your project
1. Clone your fork to your local machine
1. Install Node.js dependencies
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    ```
    npm install bcrypt
    ```
1. Install an ESLint plugin for your editor. For example: [linter-eslint](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint) for Atom.
1. Install MongoDB
    ```
    brew tap mongodb/brew
    brew install mongodb-community@4.2
    ```
1. Start MongoDB
    ```
    brew services start mongodb-community@4.2
    ```
1. MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schema. After installing mongodb you can interact with it in the command-line by typing 'mongo'.
To see our interactions with mongo please see our db/migrations directory.
For further infomration on how to interact with mongo look up mongo cheat sheets e.g.:
[MongoDB Cheat Sheet](https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2012/12/MongoDB-CheatSheet-v1_0.pdf)
### Start
1. Start the server
    ```
    npm start
    ```
1. Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
### Test
* Run all tests
    ```
    npm test
    ```
* Run a check
    ```bash
    npm run lint              # linter only
    npm run test:unit         # unit tests only
    npm run test:integration  # integration tests only
    ```
#### Start test server
The server must be running locally with test configuration for the
integration tests to pass.
```
npm run start:test
```
This starts the server on port `3000` and uses the `mockbuster_test` MongoDB database,
so that integration tests do not interact with the development server.
